## Maddie Bevacqua
I love animals a lot. My favourite animals are frogs. I have been vegetarian for _13 years_ and **vegan** for _3 years_. I only eat raw foods with the exception of ezekiel bread. I like alternative music and my favourite bands are **The Smiths, The Cure, The Killers, Cage the Elephant and Joy Division.** I have been to around 50 concerts. My favourites were Morrissey, The Cure, Psychedelic Furs, and The Killers. I have dual citizenship. My two front teeth are fake.
